# Disaster recovery
This runbook outlines the steps to take in the event of a major incident and links to individual product recovery

# General incident Scenarios
Types of incident that would be considered major are:

- Complete loss of a product
- Loss of an AWS account
- Loss of networking

Other failures which will not affect the availability of an application, but will impact a teams ability to deploy:

- Loss of Terraform state
- Loss of access
- Loss of AWS CodePipelines and Github Actions
- Loss of Github

## Identification of an incident

This may come from various sources, users, alerts or other.

## Gather information

Gather all the information on the incident that you can and record it.

- Who is affected?
- What is affected?
- What is the impact?
- When did this start?
- Were there any changes recently? (link to pull request or commit)
- Are there any [AWS health dashboard issues](https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/account/dashboard/open-issues)

## Communicate with the team and users

Post in the [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel using `@cloud-ops` to make all team members aware.

Communicate regularly with users, even if there is no resolution to keep them aware of progress.

If the incident is a security incident [report it to the security team](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/).

## Log a support ticket

If the incident cannot be resolved within the team or if the issue lies with a 3rd party log a support ticket with the 3rd party.
For AWS support, log a call in the AWS account affected.

3rd Party | How to log a support ticket | Escalation process
---|---|---
AWS| [Creating a support case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html)| On the case, or post in #ext-awssupport

## Resolution
- When the incident is resolved let users know.
- Arrange a time for an incident retro so that any lessons from the incident can be learned.

# Product recovery

This section includes information specific to recovering each of our products.

## [DHCP DNS recovery](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dns-dhcp-disaster-recovery)

This repo contains an interactive script which can be used to roll back a corrupt config file for the [DNS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dns-server) or [DHCP](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dhcp-server) services.
