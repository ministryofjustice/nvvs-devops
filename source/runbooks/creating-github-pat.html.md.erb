# Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token

We use a service GitHub account to create `personal access tokens`.

## Prerequisties

- [1Password Enterprise](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/password-storage-and-management-guide/#password-storage-and-management-guide)
- [oathtool](https://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/oathtool.1.html) to generate a [one time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password)

## Accessing the service account details
> **Note:**
> Use an `incognito` browser session to generate token to be sure not to create in your own account.

Open the 1Password vault and search for [staff-infrastructure-moj](https://github.com/staff-infrastructure-moj).
Open a new incognito browser session and copy the user, password then create a one time password using the code in the secure notes on the GitHub challenge.

## Creating a PAT
> **Warning:**
> Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them.

Once logged into the `staff-infrastructure-moj` account. Follow GitHub's latest guidance on creating a PAT [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token).
