## Stand Up 

Our stand-ups run daily at 09:30 and last for fifteen minutes.  We will follow one of two formats:

- **Walk The Board**

    Starting with the "Done" column we discuss any active issues in GitHub via [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cloud-operations-team-622a0b371800e400133bb924/board)

- **Yesterday, Today, Blockers**

    A round robin of each team member discussing their issues and any blockers.

## Sprint Planning 

Each Sprint is two weeks long and starts on a Wednesday. 
We use [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io/) to run a one-hour session. Template agenda below:

1. Discuss the previous sprint and if we met our goal, did we achieve anything outside of our goal? (10m).
1. Discuss issues in the backlog and add sticky notes for a potential sprint goal and any risks concerns (10m).
1. Reveal all stickies and vote for your favourite 5 votes (2m).
1. Discuss the top 3 goals and finalise a sprint goal (15m).
1. Discuss and finalise any concerns (5m).
1. Pull issues into the sprint.
1. Any other business.

## Backlog Refinement

On Monday mornings we have a forty-five minute session on backlog refinement. The purpose of this ceremony is for the team to agree that any issues created have enough information for any other team member to pick up.  Once a issue is refined we estimate it using the [Fibonacci scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_scale_(agile)).

## Backlog Grooming

A weekly thirty-minute ceremony for ensuring the top of the backlog is prioritised.  It also stimulates discussion about potenital new issues that should be created before refinement the following week.

## Show & Tell

At the end of each sprint we have a thirty-minute show and tell showcase to share with our colleagues and the wider organisation our achievements during the sprint. At the end of each sprint we have a thirty-minute show and tell showcase to share with our colleagues and the wider organisation our achievements during the sprint. The showcase normally consists of an introduction summing up the sprint and if we met our sprint goal followed by demonstration and then what’s next in the road map.

## Sprint Retrospective

At the end of each sprint we have a one-hour retrospective.  This is for the team to openly discuss positives and negatives of the sprint.  The format, using [Parabol](https://parabol.co), is regularly changed to keep the retro fresh and effective. 

## Learn Tech

We allocate Friday afternoons to learning. This time could be spent using one of the companies  resources such as Pluralsight, myLearning or any 3rd party course. Alternatively you may wish to spend the time looking into new technically or features that could benefit the team and our users. Lightning Talks and Demonstrations of any outcomes are greatly encouraged and welcomed.
