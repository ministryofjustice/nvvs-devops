# Our Alliance

As a team, we regularly discuss and decide on our alliance. We document these openly and publicly.

- We agree that it’s ok to disagree and challenge opinions.
- We agree that there are no stupid questions.
- We appreciate work takes time.
- We are respectful of others time.
- We code in the open.
- We have fun.
