# Our Alliance

As a team, we regularly discuss and decide on our alliance. We document these openly and publicly.

- We communicate and code in the open.
- We agree that it’s ok to disagree and challenge opinions.
- We learn from each other and ask lots of questions.
- We are respectful of others time.
- We commit to continual learning and development.
- We actively encourage feedback and thoughts on our work.
- We have fun.
