### VSCode 

The team uses [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a daily basis. 

Some of our preferred extensions are listed below, to install these extensions on VSCode (_Ctrl + Shift + P; "Install Extensions"_):

- [Remote WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) (Open any folder in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set, install the requested updates for Ubuntu when prompted)

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more)

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (Real-time collaborative development from the comfort of your favorite tools.)

- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) (Syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Terraform)

- [Gitmoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seatonjiang.gitmoji-vscode) üòé (An emoji tool for your git commit messages)

- [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bung87.rails) (Ruby on Rails support for Visual Studio Code)

- [Tabnine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) (üë©‚Äçüíªü§ñ JavaScript, Python, Java, Typescript & all other languages - AI Code completion plugin. Tabnine makes developers more productive by auto-completing their code.)

- (optional) Change your colour scheme. Save your eyes! üëÄ 
[Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) üßõ is a good one. 

If you've installed any Extensions prior to installing Remote WSL, re-install them on the WSL Ubuntu. To do this an 'Install' button should appear on these extensions when viewed on the Extensions (under WSL:
Ubuntu) submenu on the left hand side of VS Code.
