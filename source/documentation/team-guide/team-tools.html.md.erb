# Team Tools

The intended readership of this page is new joiners to the team, the page illustrates tools which the team use frequently.

### MacOS

Engineers will be provided with MacBooks, this means Unix tools are native and ready to use (no need for things like WSL see bleow).
Some additional software and commandline tools are subsequently required, they can be quickly installed following these instructions.

Follow instructions on this repository [linuxify](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/linuxify)


### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 🐧

This is only relevent for laptops with Windows.

Follow the instructions on this [repository provision-ubuntu2004-on-wsl2](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/provision-ubuntu2004-on-wsl2)

#### Ubuntu
- In Start search for 'Ubuntu' and start the Ubuntu system.

- This will prompt you to create a User, do so. You will use this username later.

#### Windows Terminal
To access Settings open Windows Terminal and click the V arrow on the Taskbar:

- Change Default Profile to Ubuntu

- In the Ubuntu Profile, edit the Startup Directory to \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\\**your-ubuntu-username**/

- Save your settings

- Restart the app and confirm you can access your Ubuntu subsystem

- (optional) Change your colour scheme. Save your eyes! 👀


### VSCode

The team uses [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a daily basis.

Some of our preferred extensions are listed below, to install these extensions on VSCode (_Ctrl + Shift + P; "Install Extensions"_):

- [Remote WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) (Open any folder in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set, install the requested updates for Ubuntu when prompted)

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more)

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (Real-time collaborative development from the comfort of your favorite tools.)

- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) (Syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Terraform)

- [Gitmoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seatonjiang.gitmoji-vscode) 😎 (An emoji tool for your git commit messages)

- [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bung87.rails) (Ruby on Rails support for Visual Studio Code)

- [Tabnine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) (👩‍💻🤖 JavaScript, Python, Java, Typescript & all other languages - AI Code completion plugin. Tabnine makes developers more productive by auto-completing their code.)

[Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) 🧛 is a good one.

If you've installed any Extensions prior to installing Remote WSL, re-install them on the WSL Ubuntu. To do this an 'Install' button should appear on these extensions when viewed on the Extensions (under WSL:
Ubuntu) submenu on the left hand side of VS Code.
