# Team Tools

The intended readership of this page is new joiners to the team, the page illustrates tools which the team use frequently.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 🐧

Download the Ubuntu subsytem from the [Company Portal](companyportal:ApplicationId=59ecb0a7-0f6b-45fc-8242-1135bc2b538b).

To successfully start the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) here and update the package (if you don't starting Ubuntu will fail)
https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel as detailed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package)

#### Ubuntu
- In Start search for 'Ubuntu' and start the Ubuntu system.

- This will prompt you to create a User, do so. You will use this username later.

#### Windows Terminal
To access Settings open Windows Terminal and click the V arrow on the Taskbar:

- Change Default Profile to Ubuntu

- In the Ubuntu Profile, edit the Startup Directory to \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\\**your-ubuntu-username**/

- Save your settings

- Restart the app and confirm you can access your Ubuntu subsystem

- (optional) Change your colour scheme. Save your eyes! 👀


### VSCode 

The team uses [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on a daily basis. 

Some of our preferred extensions are listed below, to install these extensions on VSCode (_Ctrl + Shift + P; "Install Extensions"_):

- [Remote WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) (Open any folder in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set, install the requested updates for Ubuntu when prompted)

- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more)

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (Real-time collaborative development from the comfort of your favorite tools.)

- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) (Syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Terraform)

- [Gitmoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vtrois.gitmoji-vscode) 😎 (An emoji tool for your git commit messages)

- [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bung87.rails) (Ruby on Rails support for Visual Studio Code)

- [Tabnine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) (👩‍💻🤖 JavaScript, Python, Java, Typescript & all other languages - AI Code completion plugin. Tabnine makes developers more productive by auto-completing their code.)

- (optional) Change your colour scheme. Save your eyes! 👀 
[Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) 🧛 is a good one. 

If you've installed any Extensions prior to installing Remote WSL, re-install them on the WSL Ubuntu. To do this an 'Install' button should appear on these extensions when viewed on the Extensions (under WSL:
Ubuntu) submenu on the left hand side of VS Code.
