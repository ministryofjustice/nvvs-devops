# Developing on a branch


Provided the repository is not already pulled locally:

`git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/\<your-repo-name>.git`

`cd \<your-repo-name>`

Confirm you are on the main branch:

`git status`

Update the repository with any changes to the main branch (if the repository already exists locally):

`git pull`

Create and checkout a new branch:

`git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`

_At this stage the team works collaboratively to edit the code, to complete the ticket as illustrated in its Definition of Done._

Running `git status` reflects all changes made to files in the preceding step.

Stage all altered files:

`git add -A`

Commit the newly stages files:

`git commit -m ":gitmoji: <your meaningful commit message> `
