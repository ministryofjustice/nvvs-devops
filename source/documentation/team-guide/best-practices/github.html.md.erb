# Github

After joining the team you will be added to the [GitHub Team](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/nvvs-devops-admins) and you will be given access to AWS accounts via SSO. The actual authorisation happens every 6 hours. "At minute 0 past every 6th hour from 0 through 23."
In an emergency Ops can [run it on demand](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account/blob/main/runbook.md#run-github-to-aws-scim-job-manually)

The NVVS Dev Ops team follows a GitOps style workflow.  Any changes to the system should be made via a pull request against the appropriate repository.

## All changes via Pull Request

All work undertaken by a member of the NVVS Dev Ops team will take place in a branch as per [MoJ Technical Guidance](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/using-git.html). An example of creating a branch to work on is [here](../developing-on-a-branch.html).

## Commit Early, Commit Often

If you're asking yourself "should I commit now"? then the answer is probably yes!  Committing regularly helps with avoiding conflicts.  It is especially helpful when you're pulled away to another task and need a little reminder of where you were.

## Main Branch

As GitHubs default practice our main branch is named 'main' and not 'master'. More information [here](https://github.com/github/renaming).

## Gitmoji ðŸ˜Ž

Yes, it made it to our best practices!  [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) is a great way to tag commits according to what they're doing. It's a great suppliment to your commit messages and can help identify key commits quickly.

Most of all - [have fun ðŸ¥š](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) .
