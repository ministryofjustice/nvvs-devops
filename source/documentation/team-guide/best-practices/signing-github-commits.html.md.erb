## Sign your commits

>**Tips**:
>
>To configure your Git client to sign commits by default for a local repository,  
>run `git config commit.gpgsign true`.  
>
>To sign all commits by default in any local repository on your computer,  
>run `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`.

1. When committing changes in your local branch, add the -S flag to the git commit command:  
`git commit -S -m "your commit message"`  

1. When you've finished creating commits locally, push them to your remote repository on GitHub:  
`git push`
