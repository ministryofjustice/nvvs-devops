# Re-configure AWS Vault

Follow this guide to re-configure your [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) to work with [AWS SSO](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/).  

> **Note:**  
>
> This guide is for re-configuring AWS Vault running on **Ubuntu**.  

## Prerequisites

To be able to follow this guide to setup the AWS SSO, you need to have the following already:  

- [GPG](https://gnupg.org/index.html) installed.  
- [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#installing) set up.  
- Access to [Moj AWS SSO](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/).  

## Generate a GPG key  

We will need a GPG key to encrypt credentials in a password store later. So, let's start by generating a GPG key. Run the following command:  

`gpg --full-generate-key`  

Press `Enter` for `Please select what kind of key you want:`, to select the default value.  

Press `Enter` again for `What keysize do you want? (3072)`, to select the given size.  

Press `Enter` again for `Key is valid for? (0)`, to set the key to never expire.  

Confirm this by typing `Y` for `Is this correct? (y/N)` in next step and then press `Enter`.  

Provide a ID for the key in the next step as below:  

Type `<your username> Password Storage Key` for `Real name:`  

You may leave `Email address:` and `Comment:` blank.  

Finally, confirm all by typing `O` to accept Okay.  

It will prompt for a `Passphrase`. Create a new passphrase to protect the GPG key.  

A new GPG key is now created.  

## Export GPG_TTY variable  

If you do not already have, add the below in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:  

````  
# git gpg signing  
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)  
```` 

## Install and initialise pass

We will use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) as the `backend` for `aws-vault` later. So, let's install it.  

### Install  

Run the below command:  

`sudo apt-get install pass` 

### Setting it up  

To begin, run the following command:  

`pass init "<your username> Password Storage Key"`  

Here, `<your username> Password Storage Key` is the ID of the GPG key that you created in the previous step.  

A new Password Store is now created in `~/.password-store`.  

## Finally, update the config file

Add to / replace with the below, your `~/.aws/config` file and save.  

````
[default]  
region=eu-west-2  
output=json  
 
[profile mojo-shared-services]  
sso_start_url = https://moj.awsapps.com/start  
sso_region = eu-west-2  
sso_account_id = <shared services AWS account ID>  
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess  
region = eu-west-2  
output = json  

[profile mojo-development]  
sso_start_url = https://moj.awsapps.com/start  
sso_region = eu-west-2  
sso_account_id = <development AWS account ID>   
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess  
region = eu-west-2  
output = json  

[profile mojo-pre-production]  
sso_start_url = https://moj.awsapps.com/start  
sso_region = eu-west-2  
sso_account_id = <pre production AWS account ID>   
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess  
region = eu-west-2  
output = json  

[profile mojo-production]  
sso_start_url = https://moj.awsapps.com/start  
sso_region = eu-west-2  
sso_account_id = <production AWS account ID>   
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess  
region = eu-west-2  
output = json  

[profile mojo-shared-services-cli]  
region = eu-west-2  
credential_process = /usr/local/bin/aws-vault exec mojo-shared-services --json --backend=pass --prompt=pass  

[profile mojo-development-cli]  
credential_process = /usr/local/bin/aws-vault exec mojo-development --json --backend=pass --prompt=pass  

[profile mojo-pre-production-cli]  
credential_process = /usr/local/bin/aws-vault exec mojo-pre-production --json --backend=pass --prompt=pass  

[profile mojo-production-cli]  
credential_process = /usr/local/bin/aws-vault exec mojo-production --json --backend=pass --prompt=pass  
````  

## Test your AWS Cli  

Run the below, to set the `AWS_PROFILE` to use the shared services account:  

`export AWS_PROFILE=mojo-shared-services-cli`  

Then, run the below aws command:  

`aws sts get-caller-identity`  

When prompted, provide the passphrase for GPG key you created earlier.  

You will then see web page on your browser to authorise a request:  

![AWS SSO authorisation prompt](images/aws_sso_auth_prompt.png)  

Click `Allow`.  

You should see the below in the terminal:

````
{  
    "UserId": "<your username>@digital.justice.gov.uk",  
    "Account": "<shared services AWS account id>",  
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::<shared services AWS account id>:assumed-role/<your username>@digital.justice.gov.uk"  
}  
````  

Congratulations, you have successfully configured your AWS Vault to work with AWS SSO.
