Welcome to the team! Below is some information that you might find useful.

## General information

- Our standups are currently at 09.30am every morning.
- Our sprints are two weeks and start on Wednesdays.
- We plan our sprints through the GitHub extension [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cloud-operations-team-622a0b371800e400133bb924/board).

### Team

Please see our [team information](../../#general-information) for:

- Who's in the team
- Our alliance
- Our roadmap
- Our ceremonies

### Your first sprint ceremonies

When you join the team, we want you to feel welcome and included. With your input, we'll collectively update our [team alliance](../../../documentation/general-information/our-alliance.html), and you'll be able to meet the team if you haven't done so already.

## Tools

### Communication


We use Microsoft Teams and Google Meet for team calls, and use Slack for direct calls.

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication.

Download Slack from the [Company Portal](companyportal:ApplicationId=5b3a3776-9335-4994-b940-edb324794764) on your MoJ issued laptop. 

We have three main Slack channels listed below.

#### #mojo-cloud-ops

The [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel is our team channel where we have team discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

#### #ask-cloud-ops

The [#ask-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C026AFE617T) channel is for anyone who isn't in the team to:

- ask questions about the services we run
- get advice from the team

#### #mojo-cloud-ops-notifications

The [#mojo-cloud-ops-notifications](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C023F6BDH2S) channel is where we direct notifications from GitHub, such as pull requests or issues.

It's a noisy channel, so it's up to you whether to join it.

#### GitHub teams to join (optional)

To add or close issues in our GitHub Project, you need to join the [cloud-ops-admins](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/cloud-ops-admins) team on GitHub.
You can request to join or post a message in [#mojo-cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P) channel and someone in the team will help you.

## Further information

We're currently building our documentation to cover core concepts and general practices within the team.

It's worth having a read through the user guide and concepts pages.

There is a varying level of technical detail across the documentation, so if you have any questions or are interested in something in particular, feel free to reach out in [#cloud-ops](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01J2L0SC0P).
