## NACS (Network Access Control System)
The NACS service enables the validation and authorisation of both wired and wireless network clients on MOJ enabled networks.

## User needs

Provides access to MOJ networks from suitably configured devices.

## Principles

Enable onsite support staff to manage access of local devices such as printers e.g. [Printer Mac Address reservation](https://kb.isc.org/docs/what-are-host-reservations-how-to-use-them).

[Use cloud first](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-cloud-first) To meet point 5 of the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice) (TCoP) and the governmentâ€™s cloud first policy.

[Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) provides a complete audit of changes, versioning of cloud infrastructure and DNS server application, automated testing and redeployment of the service in the event of disaster.

## Tools

The NACS service uses [Freeradius](https://www.freeradius.org) containers running on [AWS ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html), as well as a seperate ruby on rails admin portal.

We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) and [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) to provide a complete audit of changes, versioning of components, automated testing and redeployment of the service in the event of disaster.
