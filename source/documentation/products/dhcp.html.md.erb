`Helps devices when cabled, reach the internet by configuring IP settings`

The MoJO-DHCP service is a client device facing service which automatically configures client device settings when cabled.

## User needs

Allows Public internet connectivity for prison staff and enables modern devices.

## Principles

Enable onsite support staff to manage local devices e.g. [DHCP reservation](https://kb.isc.org/docs/what-are-host-reservations-how-to-use-them) using GOV.UK Design System styles and patterns.

[Use cloud first](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-cloud-first) To meet point 5 of the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice) (TCoP) and the governmentâ€™s cloud first policy. 

[Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) provides a complete audit of changes, versioning of cloud infrastructure and DNS server application, automated testing and redeployment of the service in the event of disaster. 

## Tools

The DHCP service uses [ISC KEA](https://www.isc.org/kea/) containers running on [AWS ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html).
We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) and [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) to provide a complete audit of changes, versioning of components and the DNS server application, automated testing and redeployment of the service in the event of disaster.
