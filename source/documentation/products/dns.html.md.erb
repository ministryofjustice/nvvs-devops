`Protected domain name resolution for staff devices`

The MoJO-DNS service is a client device facing service, used to resolve [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) queries within the MoJ local area network.

The service will provide DNS resolution requests for the following:

- A DNS resolution request from a device on the internal, wired network.
- A DNS resolution request from outside the wired network.

## User needs

Unlock access to the public internet to enable new devices for staff.

## Principles
Allow our staff access to modern devices by unlocking public internet.

Prevent access to malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, viruses, malicious sites, and spyware.  [NCSC protective DNS service](https://ncsc.gov.uk/information/pdns).

[Use cloud first](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-cloud-first) To meet point 5 of the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice) (TCoP) and the government’s cloud first policy.

[Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) provides full audit of changes, automated testing, redeployment of the service in the event of failure or disaster.

## Tools

The DNS service uses [BIND ISC](https://www.isc.org/bind/) containers running on [AWS ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html).
We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) and [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code). This provides an audit of changes, versioning of components and automated testing and redeployment of the service in the event of disaster.
