# 009 - Use AWS SSO for AWS Account Access

Date: 2021-05-01

## Status
✅ Accepted

## Context

We need to use Single Sign On to access all our AWS accounts.
We currently use AzureAD for securing access to many of our services.

## Decision

We will use the [Modernisation Platforms](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform) implementation of  [AWS Single Sign On](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/concepts/environments/single-sign-on.html#single-sign-on). It is being used by many teams already so means less development time forour growing team. It does require the use of a MoJ Org GitHub account, but that requirement only further facilitates using [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) within our AWS accounts.

### Alternative Considerations:
#### AzureAD
AzureAD is currently managed externally, this means that automating user and groups is not possible which limits its potential.
