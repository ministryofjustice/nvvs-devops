# 003 - Use AWS Elastic Container Service for DHCP DNS
Date: 2020-05-27

## Status
✅ Accepted

## Context

We will need to run our [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (Domain Name System) somewhere that support both TCP and UDP load balancing.

## Decision

We have decided to use AWS Elastic Container Services. ECS is a fully managed container service. There is support for TCP and UDP network traffic with AWS load balancers.

## Consequences

### Advantages

Less administrative overhead than running virtual machines e.g. EC2 and less complexity than EKS.



### Disadvantages

Still need to provision the service, require CI/CD tooling, operational documentation and forever maintaining those things.
