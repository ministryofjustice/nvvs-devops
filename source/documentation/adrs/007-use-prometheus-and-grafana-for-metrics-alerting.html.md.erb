# 007 - Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerting
Date: 2020-07-07

## Status
✅ Accepted

## Context

There is a need to ensure [PTTP](https://ministry-of-justice-acronyms.service.justice.gov.uk/#:~:text=Prison%20Technology%20Transformation%20Programme) systems e.g. DHCP, DNS and the networking equipment carrying those services are functioning and healthy.

The metrics and alerts for the services are available, but spread in multiple consoles making it hard for support engineers to get a overall view of the health of PTTP.

As more services from [PTTP](https://ministry-of-justice-acronyms.service.justice.gov.uk/#:~:text=Prison%20Technology%20Transformation%20Programme) come online, we need a flexible monitoring solution which can consolidate the metric data.

**Update October 2021**
Amazon Managed Service for Promethues and Grafana are available. Ticket created to investigate [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-metric-aggregation-server/issues/16).

**Update 7th January 2022**
The [IMA infrastructure](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-monitoring) can be moved to Cloud Platform, but requires the following issue ([see issue here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3454)) resolved.

## Decision

Use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for visualisaton and alerting.
- Aligned with wider [MoJ teams](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering/issues/147)
- Promethues is lightweight, uses [pull rather than push](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/faq/#why-do-you-pull-rather-than-push), can be containerised and run from a development machine.
- Prometheus [Exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) allow collection of metrics from network devices using [SNMP](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter), as well as the many [native](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#software-exposing-prometheus-metrics) applications
- Grafana to visualise a [wide variety](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/) of sources.
- Grafana can send notifications when a custom metric thresholds. Can be easily integrated into Slack (when availble ServiceNow)
- Can be deployed into our existing CI/CD pipelines used for DHCP/DNS.
