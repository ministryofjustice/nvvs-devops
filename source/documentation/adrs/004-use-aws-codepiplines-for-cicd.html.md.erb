# 004 - Use AWS CodePipelines for CI/CD
Date: 2020-05-13

## Status
⌛️ Superseded see [Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD](011-use-github-actions-for-ci-cd.html)

## Context

We need a [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)​ solution to support [PTTP](https://ministry-of-justice-acronyms.service.justice.gov.uk/#:~:text=Info-,PTTP,-Prison%20Technology%20Transformation) teams when deploying infrastructure and services into AWS.

## Decision

We have decided to use AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline for [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)​. It’s a fully managed service from Amazon Web Services and provides the following benefits.

- Native integration with AWS cloud estate SDK and CDK.
- Cross AWS account support
- Support for AWS Parameter Store
- Pipelines can be defined as YAML in a central repository
