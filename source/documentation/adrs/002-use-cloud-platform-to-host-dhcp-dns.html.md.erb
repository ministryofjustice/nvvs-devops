# 002 - Use Cloud Platform to host DHCP and DNS
Date: 2020-05-22

## Status 
‚ùå Rejected

## Context

We will need to run our [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (Domain Name System) and Monitoring systems somewhere. [MoJ Technical Guidance](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/hosting.html#how-to-host-services) states you must use [Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) by default.

## Decision

After [investigations](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/1897#issuecomment-632592093) by Cloud Platform team, there are [issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/79523#issuecomment-595405745) with Network Load Balancers passing both UDP and TCP. This is a requirement for running DHCP and DNS services.

**Update 6th January 2021**

The Cloud Platform `live` cluster is now running on Kubernetes 1.20 which should allow TCP and UDP on the network load balancer 

([see issue here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/1897#issuecomment-1006539120))

**Update 7th January 2022**

There is an outstanding Cloud Platform issue to look at the CP CIDR overlap with the wider connected networks on the Transit Gateway. This will need to be resolved before migration of services.

([see issue here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3454))

## Consequences

- Build, maintain our own infrastructure to host these services.
- Increased costs, knowledge required to run all the things.
